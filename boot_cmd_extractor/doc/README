This piece of code was written to meet a requirement related to 
extracting boot commands used for devices in Linaro's LAVAv1.

The main code resides in the BootCommandExtractor class, which is 
available in ../lib. It's instantiated in extractBootCommands.py,
which is the script to be used for extracting boot commands from
device configuration files.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
===================
-properly implement exception treatment methods (for now, some 
errors reach STDOUT, which is not pretty elegant, especially when
used in conjuction with Jenkins or other automated tools)
-additional text processing
